### What is this series?

Most programmers donâ€™t bother about how their code executes, but you might be surprised if I tell you some programmers are built differently. They won't stop until they get to know their programming language deeply. That's where the under-the-hood series fits in. Filled with intuitive diagrams and simple explanations.

### Action plan

- Blog each language 
- Create a website containing blog links and diagrams of language inner working, below is an example of diagrams I'll be presenting to you.
